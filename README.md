Build Predictive model to classify the heart attack using different machine learning algorithms.

# 🫀 Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical attributes using supervised machine learning models.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Early prediction of heart attacks using clinical and biometric features can help in timely intervention and prevention. This project explores machine learning methods to predict heart attack risk from patient data.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-attack-prediction)
- **Size**: 303 records, 14 features
- **Attributes Include**:
  - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, Max Heart Rate, etc.

---

## 🧠 Approach

The workflow followed:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding distributions, outliers, and correlations.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature selection.
3. **Model Building** – Comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and other classifiers.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 📈 Results

- Best performing model: `Random Forest Classifier`
- Accuracy Achieved: **~90%** (replace with actual)
- Top features influencing prediction: `Age`, `Chest Pain Type`, `Max Heart Rate`, etc.
